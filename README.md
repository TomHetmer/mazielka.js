X06 FFT Decoder

X06 is a selective call system used by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It uses six tones, which are assigned numbers 1 to 6. The system allows 720 unique tone combinations, but in practice only about 60 are being used.

The X06 signal functions as an alert for an upcoming Serdolik transmission. The transmission in this mode can come up a few minutes after X06 on the same frequency, but is usually on a different one.

X06 is frequently heard unscheduled, but there are many loose schedules known, which transmit on one weekday of a month (e.g. second Tuesday), on a particular frequency in a particular time frame.
